An Examination of the Central Limit Theorem Using an Exponential Distribution
According to the CLT, the sample mean, $\bar X$, is approximately normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$. In this report, I will use a series of simulations (Simulation #1) that calculates the average of 40 random variables, selected from an exponential distribution with a lambda of .2, over the course of 1000 simulations, to demonstrate that $\bar X$, is approximately normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$. Additionally, I will use aforementioned simulations to demonstrate how, as the number of samples increase, the sample mean and sample variance converge towards their respective theoretical values. Finally, I will use another simulation (Simulation #2) that takes 1,000 samples from the same exponential distribution to focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials, as demonstrated by Simulation #2, and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials, as demonstrated by Simulation #1, as a means to show that even thought the underlying distribution is not normal, as demonstrated by the former, the sampling distribution of the sample means, as demonstrate by the latter, is approximately normal.
