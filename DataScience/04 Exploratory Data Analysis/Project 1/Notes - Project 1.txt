Variables
1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
3.Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
4.Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
6.Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
7.Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 
8.Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 
9.Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Loading the data
	Dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns
	Only use data from the dates 2007-02-01 & 2007-02-02 (Feb 1 & 2 of 2007); i.e. 01/02/2007 & 02/02/2007
	Convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the strptime() and as.Date() functions.
	Missing values are coded as ? (there are no NAs in specified subset)

Making Plots
For each plot you should:
	Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels
	Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
	Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot
	Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced
	You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
	Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
	When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date
