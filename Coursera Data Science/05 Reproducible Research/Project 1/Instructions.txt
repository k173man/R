Loading and preprocessing the data

+++++ Part 1 +++++
What is mean total number of steps taken per day (ignore the missing values)?
	1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
	2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
	3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

+++++ Part 2 +++++
What is the average daily activity pattern?
	1. Make a time series plot (type = "l")
	 - X-Axis = 5-minute interval
	 - Y-Axis = average number of steps taken, averaged across all days
	2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

+++++Part 3 +++++
	1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
	2. Imputing missing values by devising a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset
		- Possible strategies:
		    + mean/median for that day
		    + mean for that 5-minute interval
	3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
	4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate
	  - For the total number of steps taken per day, report:
	    + The mean
  	  + The median
		- Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
		- What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

+++++ Part 4 +++++
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
	Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part; the weekdays() function will be helpful
	1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels weekday & weekend
	2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (type = "l")
	 - X-Axis = 5-minute interval
	 - Y-Axis = average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (a panel for each factor)
