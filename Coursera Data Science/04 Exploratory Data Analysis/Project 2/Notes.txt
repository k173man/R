You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis
For each question/task you will need to make a single plot
Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.

Question #1
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the US from 1999-2008?
	Use the base plotting system
	Plot total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
	X = 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008
	Y = sum (Emissions) group by year

Question #2
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999-2008?
	Use the base plotting system
	X = 1999...2008
	Y = sum (Emissions) group by year

Question #3
Which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? 
Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999?2008? 
	Use the ggplot2 (could use multiple lines or facets)
	X = 1999...2008
	Y = sum (Emissions) group by year, type

Question #4
Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008?
	Use RegEx on fields in SCC dataset to filter on coal & combustion
	
Question #5
How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City? 

Question #6
Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). 
Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?


Making and Submitting Plots
For each plot you should
?Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
?Upload the PNG file on the Assignment submission page
?Copy and paste the R code from the corresponding R file into the text box at the appropriate point in the peer assessment.
