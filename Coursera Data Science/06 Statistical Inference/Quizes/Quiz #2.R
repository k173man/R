# Q2 - units are expressed as mm Hg
## Diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) for men aged 35-44 are normally distributed (u = 80, sd = 10)
## What is the approx. probability that a random 35-44 year old has a DBP < 70?
u = 80
sd = 10
x = 70

pnorm(x, u, sd)

# Q3 - units are expressed as cc
## Brain volume for adult women is normally distributed (u = 1,100, sd = 75)
## What brain volume represents the 95th percentile?
u = 1100
sd = 75
x = 70

pnorm(x, u, sd)
